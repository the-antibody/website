    <i>Open source software made for the user, not the developer.</i>

    <div id="why">
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
            It's not just the fact that unfortunately there are many people on the internet who are "out to get you" that upsets me.<br>
            It's not even the fact that some of them develop malware and use it to infect other people without their permission,<br>
            giving legitimate malware analysts & developers a bad name that upsets me.<br>
            But the fact that the public still sees it as "okay" to promote operating systems and pieces of software that are closed-source<br>
            (meaning you can't view the code), despite the very obvious reality that closed-source software is infinitely <br>
            more dangeorous and more likely to infringe upon your privacy. I support GNU's wanting to make everything free, <br>
            and by extension open source, but the reason I support this is not because of the money, but because I want to <br>
            defend the important rights the user is justly entitled to.
